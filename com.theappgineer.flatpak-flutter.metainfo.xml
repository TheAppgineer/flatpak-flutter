    <p>
      flatpak-flutter is a development tool that simplifies the publishing of Flutter based Linux apps on Flathub.
      It acts as a companion to org.flatpak.Builder, in that it performs an initial run on the manifest
      to collect all dependency sources, and make the necessary adjustments for an offline build.
